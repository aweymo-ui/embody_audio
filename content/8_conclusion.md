**Utilizing audio as a medium for presenting historical research is not just a way to reach broader audiences** – it’s also an opportunity to use the storytelling process to reassess and enhance your work moving forward. Transforming written scholarship to audio narrative challenges you to refine your arguments, clarify language and make your findings more succinct. Paring down these elements and combining them with the immersive potential of audio can help bridge a gap with a non-academic community that might otherwise feel excluded from scholarly conversations. 

Moreover, the process of recording, observing and speaking to people in your area of focus utilizes concepts of embodiment that deepen your understanding of your research subject through interacting with the space. Presenting field recordings, interviews and oral history recordings is essentially just presenting your research materials in an audio format but the medium’s ability to create a sense of place and guide the listener through the layers of a story underscores its power lacking in traditional academic outputs. By embracing these nontraditional formats, you can not only expand the reach of their work but also enrich your research process.
